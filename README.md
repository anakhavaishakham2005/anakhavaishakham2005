👋 Hi there, I’m @anakhavaishakham2005
👀 Interests: Basically, if it’s shiny, challenging, or just remotely interesting, I’m in! 🤩 From debugging code to doodling masterpieces, I’m up for everything that keeps the brain buzzing.

🌱 *Currently Growing In*:

HTML 🖥️ (Turning "Hello, World!" into "Wow, Internet!")

CSS 🎨 (Because who doesn't love pretty layouts?)

C (my one core strength💪 and the life and sole of my KTU syllabus)

Python 🐍 (Hissing my way into coding greatness!)

And honestly, a bit of everything—call me the nerd!..I just love to learn

😄 **Pronouns**:

Learner: Is now and always will be...🤓

Solver: I love being the catalyst in the reaction of conflicts😎 and also help others fix errors....

Programmer: Turning time (let’s be honest,my whole free-time🥺) into code. 💻

Artist Extraordinaire: Doodling my way through life, one masterpiece at a time!(not considered as free time😉)🎨

⚡**Fun fact**:

💻 Engaged to VSCode 💍, but sometimes I feel like I’m the one doing all the debugging in this relationship. 😅

I have a PhD in "Googling Errors🔍" and a black belt in “Helping others fix bugs, yep I'm Miss.Solver”!

🎉 Bonus Weirdness:

I might spend hours coding, then hours sketching, and still have energy to talk non-stop. Superpower? Probably.😏

I firmly believe caffeine is overrated. Stress adrenaline is where it’s at!
