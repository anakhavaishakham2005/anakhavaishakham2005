👋 Hi there, I’m @anakhavaishakham2005
👀 Interests: Basically, if it’s shiny, challenging, or just remotely interesting, I’m in! 🤩 From debugging code to doodling masterpieces, I’m up for everything that keeps the brain buzzing.

🌱 *Currently Growing In*:

HTML 🖥️ (Turning "Hello, World!" into "Wow, Internet!")

CSS 🎨 (Because who doesn't love pretty layouts?)

Python 🐍 (Hissing my way into coding greatness!)

And honestly, a bit of everything—call me the nerd!..I just love to learn

😄 **Pronouns**:
Learner: Always curious, always growing.

Solver: I love being the catalyst in the reaction of conflicts😎 and also help others fix errors....

Beginner: Every expert was once here—living it loud and proud!

Programmer: Turning time (let’s be honest,my whole free-time🥺) into code. 💻

Artist Extraordinaire: Doodling my way through life, one masterpiece at a time!(not considered as free time😉)🎨

⚡**Fun fact**:
I thrive under stress. Yep, you read that right! Deadlines, challenges, and last-minute crunches are my best friends. Procrastination? Oh sorry, we broke up long ago. 😎

I have a PhD in "Googling Errors🔍" and a black belt in “Helping others fix bugs, yep I'm Miss.Solver”!

🎉 Bonus Weirdness:

I might spend hours coding, then hours sketching, and still have energy to talk non-stop. Superpower? Probably.😏

I firmly believe caffeine is overrated. Stress adrenaline is where it’s at!
